# Cursor Support Ticket - Terminal Issue (English)

**Topic:** https://forum.cursor.com/t/connection-error-serialize-binary/148894/3

**Request ID:** `af8369f5-0104-4a3a-aa97-e456ced56ac5`

## Problem Description

After the latest Cursor update, the integrated terminal in my project stopped executing **any** commands (PowerShell). Previously, clearing `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\` helped temporarily, but now **it doesn't help** — terminals break immediately after the update/launch.

In parallel, an **Internal Error** popup appears in the chat UI, and I see an error in the logs/stack:
`[internal] serialize binary: invalid int 32: 3221226505`

## Environment

- **OS**: Windows 10 (10.0.22631)
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **Workspace**: `C:\Projects\PhotoSorter` (git repo)
- **Terminal**: integrated terminal in Cursor
- **Request ID**: `af8369f5-0104-4a3a-aa97-e456ced56ac5`

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Launch Cursor
2. Open workspace `C:\Projects\PhotoSorter`
3. Open integrated terminal (PowerShell)
4. Execute any simple command (e.g., `Get-Date` or any other)

## Actual Result

- Commands in terminal don't execute / terminal becomes unresponsive
- **Internal Error** popup appears
- Error in stack trace (see below)
- Clearing `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\` no longer restores functionality

## Expected Result

- Terminal executes commands stably
- No Internal Error in Cursor chat when working with terminal/agent

## Stack Trace Analysis

The error stack indicates a **problem in Cursor's JavaScript code** (not in the user's environment):

1. **All calls originate from Cursor's compiled JS code:**
   - `vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Program%20Files/cursor/resources/app/out/vs/workbench/workbench.desktop.main.js`
   - This is Cursor's frontend bundle (Electron/VSCode-based application)

2. **Error in binary data serialization:**
   - `serialize binary: invalid int 32: 3221226505`
   - The value `3221226505` exceeds the maximum value for int32 (`2,147,483,647`)
   - This indicates **overflow** or incorrect value during data serialization

3. **Call context:**
   - `qyt.runAgentLoop` → `Wpc.streamFromAgentBackend` → `FTe.submitChatMaybeAbortCurrent`
   - Error occurs during agent/chat operation, likely when transferring data between frontend and backend

**Conclusion:** This is a bug in Cursor's code — during binary data serialization (likely when exchanging data with agent/terminal), a value is passed that doesn't fit into int32. This could be:
- Overflow during calculations
- Incorrect handling of terminal data
- Serialization bug introduced in the update

## What I've Already Tried

- **Full cleanup** of `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\` and Cursor restart — **didn't help** (previously helped temporarily)
- **Switching to Command Prompt** (as suggested in the forum thread) — **didn't help**, the issue persists with any terminal
- The problem appeared **immediately after the latest Cursor update**

## Additional Information

The issue occurs with **any command** in the terminal, not just Python commands. Even simple PowerShell commands like `Get-Date` or `Get-Location` cause the terminal to break and trigger the Internal Error.

The error value `3221226505` is different from the one mentioned in the forum thread (`4294967295`), but both exceed int32 limits, suggesting a similar underlying issue.

## Request to Support

1. Confirm if the issue with `serialize binary: invalid int 32: 3221226505` and integrated terminal failure after update is known
2. Suggest which **additional logs** to collect and where to attach them (e.g., from `%APPDATA%\Cursor\logs\`) to help quickly identify the root cause
3. If there's a temporary workaround (terminal/PTY/shell integration settings) — provide exact steps

I can provide a screenshot of the **Internal Error** popup and any logs/dumps you specify.

**Note:** The problem appeared after the latest Cursor update. Previously, clearing workspaceStorage temporarily solved the issue, but now it doesn't help.
